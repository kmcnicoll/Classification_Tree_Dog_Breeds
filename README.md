# Classification_Tree_Dog_Breeds

Using Data from https://www.hillspet.com to see if American Kennel Club dog breed classification standards could be predicted from dog traits.
The data
Hills Pet, https://www.hillspet.com dog suppy company that has information and care data on every breed. It's purpose is to provide information to potential customers so that the prospects buy their dog food.

# The goal
The aim of this project is to use analyse the dog traits and see if average breed traits such as height, wieghts, tendancy to bar, energy level, ect, can be used to accuratly predict the AKC classifiction of the breed.

# Statistical tests used
In order to find the most effective model 9 different tests were done.


As you can see KNN preformed the best. 

# Future Applications and Importance
Gamma radation is not good for homosapiens. A cumulative exposure of 1000 mSv will cause deadly illness's such as cancer in 5/100 victims exposed years later. Our projects mission was to make sure New York States radation levels are safe and on par with eachother. Interestingly in May, in Rochester New York, radation levels were 3 times higher then everywhere else in the state. While it is still considered to be within safe levels it should still be looked into as it is radation in our drinking water.
